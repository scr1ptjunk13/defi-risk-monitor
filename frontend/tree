One-click pool creation API
• Expose a REST/GraphQL endpoint + SDK so token teams can create liquidity programmatically (pain point: manual Uniswap UI is slow and error-prone).
• Meter each call for billing.
Auth & usage tracking
• Wallet login (SIWE) or email+password via NextAuth.
• Store users & pool-creation logs in Postgres/Supabase.
Tiered billing + free quota
• Stripe metered billing: free tier (e.g. 2 pools/month), paid tiers unlock higher limits & features.
• Display remaining quota in the dashboard.
Project dashboard & analytics
• For each pool show TVL, fees earned, volume (pull via Uniswap subgraph).
• Charts + CSV export.
• Email/Webhook alerts on thresholds (e.g. TVL < $10k).
Multi-chain support
• Add Base & BSC; automatic gas estimation & chain selection.
• Pain point: teams want same liquidity on several chains without repeating steps.
Security guardrails
• Simulate tx with Tenderly / Alchemy before sending, catch errors, estimate gas.
• Warn if price ticks look wrong.
Branding & embeddable widget
• Generate a white-label “Add liquidity” button + script tag token teams can embed in their site—drives adoption and shows “real SaaS” angle.
Landing page + public metrics
• Marketing site that shows live counters (“2 134 pools created”, “$42 M TVL seeded”).
• Demo video & docs.
Simple support loop
• In-app Intercom/chat and a public roadmap/feedback board.

Ship order:

Week 1: Auth → DB → pool-creation logging
Week 2: Stripe billing + quotas
Week 3: Analytics page + email alerts
Week 4: Multi-chain and widget, polish landing page → deploy on Vercel



Once the core SaaS (auth → billing → dashboard → multi-chain) is live, shift focus from “building” to “getting adoption”. A proven playbook:

Nail the developer onboarding
• 5-min quick-start in docs (npm install + 3-line SDK example)
• Sandbox link (StackBlitz / Codesandbox) that deploys a pool on testnet instantly.
• Live status page + clear rate-limit / pricing tables.
Seed early adopters
• Hit Telegram/Discord groups of new token launches (ICO, meme-coins, Base/Polygon ecosystems).
• Offer them a coupon for the paid tier in exchange for feedback & logo placement.
• Publish case-study blog posts: “X token seeded $500k TVL in 2 minutes with Liquidity-Creator”.
Partnerships & integrations
• List on Uniswap’s “Community Tools”, Polygon “Ecosystem dApps”, and Base “Onchain Apps”.
• Add Zapier / Make.com integration (webhook on pool-created → tweet/discord alert).
• Provide a one-click Vercel template so marketing sites can embed your widget.
Community & credibility
• Open-source the SDK and maintain weekly changelog; accept PRs for new chains.
• Run a Twitter/X space every launch day to walk through pool creation live.
• Offer a badge (“Created with Liquidity-Creator”) that links back—compounding backlinks/SEO.
Growth loops
• Embeddable widget includes a small “Powered by” link → self-propagating.
• Referral credits—every pool creator gets 10 extra pool credits when someone signs up through their link.
• Leaderboard of top TVL pools built with your service.
Feedback → iteration
• Intercom auto-message after first pool: “Anything confusing? Reply here—founder online.”
• Track drop-off in funnel (connected wallet → filled form → tx confirmed). Fix biggest leaks weekly.
Run the numbers
• Goal: 100 active teams using the free tier → 10 converting to paid within 2 months.
• Use Amplitude/PostHog to monitor cohort retention; tweak pricing or limits if activation is low.
Compliance & trust signals
• Smart-contract simulations via Tenderly (show green “simulation passed” badge before user clicks sign).
• Audit the widget JS bundle; display “audited” seal if you get a quick review.
• Optional KYC add-on for teams that need it to list on CEXs.
Scale ops
• Automate support (FAQ bot trained on docs).
• Add rate-limit + alerting to prevent spam pools (Cloudflare/WAF).
• Set up backup RPC endpoints and multi-region failover (Alchemy + Infura + QuickNode).

Start small, cover the networks where

Uniswap V3 (or a compatible fork) already runs,
gas is low enough that teams actually pay to seed pools, and
developer activity is high so you’ll find early customers.
Recommended phased roll-out:

Phase 1 – core four
• Polygon (you have it) – cheap, large retail user base.
• Ethereum mainnet – credibility; some projects still seed “prestige” liquidity here.
• Arbitrum – highest L2 TVL, lots of gaming/meme launches.
• Base – fast-growing, Coinbase-backed, low fees.

Phase 2 – optional but high ROI once stable
• Optimism – similar to Arbitrum, OP airdrops attract builders.
• BNB Smart Chain – very large retail audience; use Pancake-/Uniswap-fork addresses.
• Avalanche C-Chain – active DeFi community, gas ≤ Polygon.

Skip for now
• Fantom, Gnosis, zkSync, Linea – lower volume or tooling still in flux.
• Non-EVM chains – require entirely different plumbing.

Implementation tips

Store per-chain config in a JSON/TS record: chainId → { rpc, factory, positionManager, nativeSymbol }.
Expose only chains whose contracts you’ve verified in prod env; others stay in “coming soon”.
Keep UI chain selector limited to 4–5 items to avoid overwhelming users.
This mix gives you ~80 % of Uniswap-style liquidity creation demand with minimal extra maintenance.
