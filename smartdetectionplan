You've hit on a fundamental challenge in DeFi infrastructure! Let me share some innovative approaches to solve the UX vs cost dilemma:

ðŸŽ¯ Smart Cost Optimization Strategies
1. Intelligent Protocol Detection
Instead of blindly calling all protocols, use heuristics:

rust
// Smart detection based on wallet activity patterns
async fn detect_likely_protocols(address: Address) -> Vec<Protocol> {
    // Check transaction history for protocol interactions
    // Use event logs to identify which protocols user has used
    // Only query protocols with actual activity
}
2. Tiered Discovery Approach
Tier 1 (Free): Major protocols only (Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
Tier 2 (Premium): All protocols + cross-chain
Tier 3 (Pro): Real-time monitoring + alerts
3. Caching & Batch Optimization
Address-based caching: Cache results for 5-10 minutes
Batch RPC calls: Use multicall contracts to reduce RPC costs by 80%
Background refresh: Update popular addresses proactively
4. Freemium Model Innovation
Free Tier:

Manual refresh only
Ethereum mainnet only
Top 5 protocols
10 queries/day limit
Premium ($9/month):

Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
All major chains (Polygon, Arbitrum, Base)
All protocols
Real-time alerts
Historical data
Enterprise ($99/month):

Real-time WebSocket feeds
API access
Custom alerts
Priority support
5. Cost-Efficient Architecture
rust
pub struct SmartAggregator {
    // Use different RPC providers based on cost/speed
    cheap_provider: Provider,    // For background updates
    fast_provider: Provider,     // For real-time queries
    archive_provider: Provider,  // For historical data
}
6. User-Driven Optimization
Let users "pin" their favorite protocols
Learn from usage patterns
Offer "scan all" as premium feature
ðŸ’¡ Innovative Revenue Ideas
Pay-per-scan model: $0.10 per comprehensive scan
Protocol partnerships: Revenue share with protocols for user acquisition
White-label licensing: Sell the tech to other DeFi platforms
Premium analytics: Advanced risk scoring, yield optimization suggestions
ðŸš€ Implementation Strategy
For your MVP, I'd recommend:

Start with manual refresh (current approach âœ…)
Implement smart protocol detection based on transaction history
Add basic caching to reduce repeated calls
Launch freemium model once you have 100+ users
The key insight: Most users only use 2-3 protocols actively. Smart detection can reduce RPC costs by 70% while maintaining perfect UX.

Want me to implement the smart protocol detection logic? It would analyze a wallet's transaction history to only query protocols they've actually used.
