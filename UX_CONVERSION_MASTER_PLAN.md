🎯 HONEST ANSWER: It's NOT Real-Time (Yet) - Here's the Truth:
📊 Current Reality:
✅ What IS Real-Time:
Blockchain data fetching - Every time you refresh or enter a wallet address
USD value calculations - Calculated from live liquidity amounts
Risk score calculations - Calculated from current position data
❌ What is NOT Real-Time:
No automatic updates - Only updates when you manually refresh
No live price feeds - Using estimated USD values from liquidity
No background monitoring - No continuous data streaming
No WebSocket connections - No live data push
⏱️ Current Update Frequency:
Manual Refresh Only:
- Click "Refresh" button → Fetches new data from blockchain
- Enter new wallet address → Fetches new data
- Page reload → Fetches new data
- Otherwise: STATIC DATA
🔄 Risk Score Updates:
YES - Risk scores will update when values change because:

Risk calculation happens client-side in real-time
When position values change → Risk scores recalculate automatically
When you fetch new blockchain data → New USD values → New risk scores
🚀 To Make It TRULY Real-Time, You'd Need:
WebSocket connections to blockchain data providers
Background price feed updates (every 10-30 seconds)
Live pool state monitoring for Uniswap V3 positions
Automatic refresh intervals (every 1-5 minutes)
Push notifications for significant changes
💡 Current Status:
Real-Time Level: 3/10
- ✅ Live blockchain fetching (on demand)
- ✅ Real risk calculations
- ❌ No automatic updates
- ❌ No live price feeds
- ❌ No background monitoring
🎯 Bottom Line:
Your dashboard shows REAL blockchain data with REAL risk calculations, but it's "real-time on demand" not "continuously real-time".

Every time you refresh, you get the latest blockchain state and recalculated risk scores - but it won't update automatically in the background.

For a production DeFi risk monitor, you'd definitely want to add:

Auto-refresh every 30-60 seconds
WebSocket price feeds
Background position monitoring
Alert system for risk changes

TODO 

erfect! Now I can see the real issue. Looking at the DGENV2 token page:

🔍 DGENV2 Token Analysis
Token: degeneratorv2 (DGENV2)
Max Total Supply: 30,290 tokens
Holders: 152
Market Cap: NOT LISTED (shows "-")
Circulating Supply Market Cap: NOT LISTED (shows "-")
This confirms that DGENV2 has no established market value - it's likely worth very little or nothing!

The $687,890 your system is showing is completely wrong. Here's what's happening:

❌ Current Problem: Fake USD Calculation
Your code is using this naive formula:

rust
// This is WRONG - liquidity units ≠ USD value
let estimated_usd_value = if liquidity_f64 > 1e15 {
    (liquidity_f64 / 1e15) * 50_000.0 + 10_000.0  // Results in $687K
}
✅ What We Need: Real Price Integration
To get accurate USD values, we need to:

Get token prices from DEX pools or price feeds
Calculate actual token amounts from liquidity + price range
Convert to USD using real market prices
For experimental tokens like DGENV2 and MIERDA, the real values are probably:

DGENV2/WETH: Maybe $10-$100 (if anything)
WETH/MIERDA: Maybe $50-$500 (if anything)
🔧 Quick Fix Options
Replace with realistic estimates for demo purposes
Implement real price calculation using Uniswap V3 math
Show "Price Unknown" for tokens without market data
Should I implement a quick fix to show more realistic values, or do you want to implement proper Uniswap V3 position valuation?
