# 🚀 DeFi Risk Monitor - UX Conversion Master Plan

## 🎯 **MISSION: Transform Generic Tool → Irresistible Money-Saving Machine**

**Core Insight**: "The best DeFi UX doesn't feel like DeFi UX" - Users should think "Holy shit, this saved me $5000" not "This is well-designed"

  ├─ "Curve 3Pool: MEV attacks increased 340% today"
  └─ "⚠️ Check if YOUR positions are affected"
  ```
