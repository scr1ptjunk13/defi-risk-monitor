## ðŸ’¡ Competitive Advantage

**The protocol partnerships (B2B) are the biggest opportunity** - that's where Gauntlet makes their billions. The comprehensive multi-protocol approach positions perfectly for this market since protocols want ONE platform that covers everything, not 10 different tools.

**Key Insight**: Make the free tier valuable enough to use daily, but limited enough to create upgrade pressure. Users should feel the pain of limitations within their first week.
