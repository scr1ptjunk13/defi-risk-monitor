ðŸ”¥ THE EXECUTION PLAN TO DOMINATE DEFI RISK MANAGEMENT
No more fucking around. Here's exactly what we're going to build to crush Gauntlet and Chaos Labs:

PHASE 1: REAL BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION (NEXT 7 DAYS)
Replace EVERY SINGLE MOCK with real data:

Day 1-2: Real Uniswap V3 Integration
Replace mock pool data with live Uniswap V3 pool contracts
Real position tracking from actual NFT positions
Live TVL, volume, fees from on-chain data
Day 3-4: Real Price Feeds
Chainlink price oracles for accurate token pricing
Real-time price updates via WebSocket
Historical price data for trend analysis
Day 5-7: Real Risk Calculations
Actual impermanent loss calculations using real price movements
True volatility analysis from historical data
MEV risk assessment from real transaction patterns
PHASE 2: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (NEXT 7 DAYS)
Backend Infrastructure
PostgreSQL production setup with real data persistence
Redis caching for sub-second response times
WebSocket real-time updates for live risk monitoring
Frontend Polish
Real position management with actual wallet connections
Live risk alerts that actually save users money
Performance optimization for instant loading
PHASE 3: MARKET DOMINATION (NEXT 14 DAYS)
MVP Launch Strategy
Target smaller DeFi protocols first (easier to penetrate)
Explainable AI differentiation - show WHY risks exist
Free tier to get users hooked, premium for advanced features
Competitive Advantages
Real-time explanations (Gauntlet doesn't have this)
Retail-friendly UI (enterprise tools are complex)
AI-powered recommendations (actionable, not just alerts)
ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
Let's start with the most critical blocker - real blockchain integration. Right now, your beautiful frontend is connected to NOTHING.

What we're doing RIGHT NOW:

Fix the blockchain service to use real Uniswap V3 contracts
Replace mock position data with actual on-chain positions
Connect to real price feeds for accurate risk calculations

eal token symbol fetching complete, you're now ready to continue with:

Price Feed Aggregation - Implement multi-source price validation (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap)
Real Position Calculations - Calculate actual position values, PnL, and impermanent loss
Integration Testing - Comprehensive database integration tests
Frontend Integration - Connect the frontend to display real token symbols and risk metrics
The foundation for real blockchain integration is now complete. Next steps:
